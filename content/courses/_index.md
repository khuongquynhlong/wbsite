Besides doing research, I am also passionate about teaching. I always feel motivated to learn and share knowledge with others. Since graduation in Dec 2017, I have been teaching as a teaching assistant at Faculty of Public Health - University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, and as a Statistical instructor at Hanoi University of Public Health.

My short courses and seminars include Causal inference, Bayesian statistics, Data visualization, Longitudinal data analsysis, and reproducible principle. My courses are held annually and free for all participants.

I also taught with my professor in 12 short courses in applied epidemiology, and data analysis for public health students, clinical doctors, public health researchers, and lecturers, with more than 1000 attendees.

Please find below as the materials for my courses.
